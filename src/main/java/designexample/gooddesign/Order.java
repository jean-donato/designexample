    By doing this, we achieve three major benefits:
        -  Domain protection: Business rules are enforced inside the entity.
        -  Improved readability: The method name clearly communicates intent.
        -  Prevention of inconsistent states: Only valid transitions are allowed.

    * Additionally, this approach naturally promotes the use of Ubiquitous Language, a core DDD concept,
        ensuring that the code reflects the language of the business.
